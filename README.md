# DB-Final-Project
This project will let the user read quotes, insert quotes, update quotes, and delete quotes.

To run this project follow these steps ->  
    1. download the zip or clone the repo from git hub
    2. use cd flask-backend
    3. use flask run
    4. open another terminal and use cd react-app-frontend
    5. npm start
**note**
The app won't function properly without the database
    I am working on either publishing out the db for download or hosting it on the cloud
